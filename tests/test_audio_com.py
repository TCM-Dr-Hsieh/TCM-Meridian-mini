"""COM on the audio threads (Windows).

Every visit records on a NEW thread, and SoundCard initialises COM only on the thread that first imports it. When that
thread (the first visit's) ends, no thread holds COM any more and the next visit's thread fails with 0x800401F0
(CO_E_NOTINITIALIZED): "the second visit has no microphone". Each thread that calls SoundCard now initialises COM itself,
in this order: import soundcard, CoInitializeEx, use it, free what it returned, CoUninitialize.

The tests marked Windows run the real library in a fresh process (COM state is per process); the others use a fake
`soundcard` and a fake `ole32` and run anywhere.
